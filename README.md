# boltzmann

This library is supposed to implement [Boltzmann Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine) related deep learning technologies. All implementations should both have a clean high-level mathematical implementation of their algorithms and if possible, an optimized and benchmarked version of the core routines for production use.

This repository is supposed to cover techniques building on [Restricted Boltzmann bachines]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_Boltzmann_machine), like [Deep Belief Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_belief_network), [Deep Boltzmann Machines](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/dbm.pdf) or temporal extensions thereof.

For other deep learning related techniques like autoencoders, a seperate library was reasonable, although some general routines might be shared through another library then. The idea is that you can include specific machine learning algorithms without pulling a whole machine learning framework into your project. This is a state-of-the-art [reference for deep learning in general in Python](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/). Feel free to port examples to this library as an exercise and open pull-requests :).

## Usage

TODO put no clojars and visualize some learning

## TODO

- implement plots
- import routines (for mnist et al.)
- train some mnist
- visualize training of mnist
- add python version for comparison
- investigate numerical optimizations, single matrix with bias, minibatches
- do algorithmic optimizations
- implement/port AIS, CAST
- make incanter dev dependency
